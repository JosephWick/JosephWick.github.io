                  During my graduate course in dynamical systems, I explored the Takens
                  theory of phase space reconstruction. Takens (1981) outlines a
                  method for determining whether or not a set of data can be attributed
                  to a strange attractor. By time sampling the data, one can create a
                  phase space diagram that, for systems governed by a strange attractor,
                  forms a distinctive torus like shape. With proper selection of the
                  number of dimensions and time sampling interval, this method works even
                  for noisy systems.

                  Above is a simple phase space reconstruction for a nonchaotic system.
                  The Takens reconstruction method also works for complicated systems, see
                  below.

                  Above we have the phase space reconstruction of an N-body system
                  made up of two "stars," heavier objects, and one "planet," a lighter
                  object. After simulation, gaussian noise was added to the data. Again,
                  the Takens reconstruction produces an open shape, but due to the
                  complexity of the system and added noise, this shape is not as perfectly
                  circular as with the simpler system.

                    I made a simple n-body simulation in python for a
                    computational physics course at UCSC. The goal of my project
                    was to explore the stability of eccentric orbits around a
                    stable stellar binary, as a function of the semi major axis
                    and eccentricity of the planet's orbit. Given that the simulation
                    is coded in Python, it is pretty slow, but provided some nice insight
                    and was useful in the above Takens reconstruction project. Below is
                    an image demonstrating the stability (or lack thereof) of a planet
                    orbitting a binary at different starting locations.

                    As part of my work at the Southern California Earthquake
                    Center, I implemented hierarchical matrices into a simulation
                    of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) that included off-
                    fault viscoelastic effects. Hierarchical matrices provide an
                    approximation to a matrix vector product, reducing computation
                    time from O(n^2) to O(nlogn).
