                in computational cosmology and the development of scientific
                simulations. I am working on a masters thesis with Professors
                Alexie Leauthaud (astro) and Nic Brummel (AM) to analyze dwarf galaxy simulations
                ran under SIDM and LCDM models. </p>

  							<h2>About Me</h2>
  							<p>
                  I am currently studying Scientific Computing and Applied
                  Mathematics (SciCAM) as a masters student at UCSC. As part of
                  the SciCAM program, I am working on a thesis analyzing H1
                  simulations of dwarf galaxies ran under both self-interacting
                  dark matter (SIDM) and lambda cold dark matter (LCDM). My goal
                  is to determine observable differences in the galaxies across
                  the two different paradigms, information which can then be used
                  in follow up H1 observations. My work is part of Professor
                  Leauthaud's Merian Survey, which seeks to test SIDM by performing
                  gravitational weak lensing measurements on dwarf galaxies.
                  <br><br>
                  Prior to my graduate education, I studied physics and computer
                  science at the undergraduate level, graduating in 2022.
