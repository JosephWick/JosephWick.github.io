              computing, and the development of scientific tools. </p>

  							<h2>About Me</h2>
  							<p>
                  In October 2023, I began a position in the CPAC group at
                  Argonne National Lab. I work closely with Dr. Matthew Becker in
                  the development of differentiable code, which allows for faster
                  optimization and, as a result, more complicated models.

                  I completed my masters in Scientific Computing and Applied
                  Mathematics at UCSC in the summer of 2023. As part of
                  the SciCAM program, I am wrote my thesis on analyzing H1
                  simulations of dwarf galaxies ran under both self-interacting
                  dark matter (SIDM) and lambda cold dark matter (LCDM). My goal
                  is to determine observable differences in the galaxies across
                  the two different paradigms, information which can then be used
                  in follow up H1 observations. My work is part of Professor
                  Leauthaud's Merian Survey, which seeks to test SIDM by performing
                  gravitational weak lensing measurements on dwarf galaxies.
                    <br><br>
                  Prior to my graduate education, I studied physics and computer
                  science at the undergraduate level, graduating in 2022. As an
                  undergraduate, I worked on some data aspects of the Merian
                  survey with Professor Leauthaud, and observed remotely on the
                  Keck and Blanco telescopes. I also spent a summer as an intern
                  at the Southern California Earthquake Center, where I
                  implemented hierarchical matrices into a simulation of
                  earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS), and attended the annual
                  SCEC and Seismological Society of America conferences.
                    <br><br>
                  I first became involved in applied math and computational physics
                  through an interest in software development, and I still enjoy
                  working on small personal projects. When I'm not busy applying
                  the math or furiously typing, I also enjoy the outside world.
                  I am a fan of both watching and playing soccer, riding bikes,
                  competing in collegiate triathlons, and I recently learned
                  how to sew. I would hesitate to call myself a photographer,
                  but I'll bring a camera with me when I know I'll be somewhere
                  photogenic; below are a few of my favorite photos.
