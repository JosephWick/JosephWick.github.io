              My work focuses on the development of differentiable code
              for cosmological research and the preparation of tools for the
              exaflop era. I am broadly interested in cosmology, high performance
              computing, and the development of scientific tools. </p>

  							<h2>About Me</h2>
  							<p>
                  In October 2023, I began a position in the CPAC group at
                  Argonne National Lab. I work closely with Dr. Matthew Becker in
                  the development of a pipeline of differentiable predictions of
                  cosmological summary statistics for use on Argonne's large
                  computing resources.

                  I completed my masters in Scientific Computing and Applied
                  Mathematics (SciCAM) at UCSC in the summer of 2023. As part of
                  the SciCAM program, I am wrote my thesis on analyzing hydrodynamical
                  simulations for evidence of feedback driven breathing modes in dwarf
                  galaxies. I compared these predictions to spectroscopic data that I helped
                  to take using the Keck telescope.
                    <br><br>
                  Prior to my graduate education, I studied physics and computer
                  science at the undergraduate level, graduating in 2022. As an
                  undergraduate, I worked on some data aspects of the Merian
                  survey with Professor Leauthaud, and observed remotely on the
                  Keck and Blanco telescopes. I also spent a summer as an intern
                  at the Southern California Earthquake Center, where I
                  implemented hierarchical matrices into a simulation of
                  earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS), and attended the annual
                  SCEC and Seismological Society of America conferences.
                    <br><br>
                  I first became involved in applied math and computational physics
                  through an interest in software development, and I still enjoy
                  working on small personal projects. When I'm not busy applying
                  the math or furiously typing, I also enjoy the outside world.
                  I am a fan of both watching and playing soccer, riding bikes,
                  and I recently learned how to sew. I would hesitate to call myself
                  a photographer, but I'll bring a camera with me when I know I'll
                  be somewhere photogenic; below are a few of my favorite photos.
