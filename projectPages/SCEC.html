                  I worked for several months as an intern at the Southern
                  California Earthquake Center, working with Dr. Val√®re Lambert.
                  My project involved the implmentation of hierarchical matrices
                  into a long term earthquake simulation.
                  <br><br>
                  The accumulation of strain in off fault regions has implications
                  for the frequency and power of earthquakes, thus is important to
                  model if earthquake simulations are to serve as realistic
                  predictors. Naturally, simulating an increased volume brings
                  additional computational expense and can prove to be limiting.
                  Hierarchical matrices offer a potential solution for simulations
                  utilizing the boundary integral method, which loads strain onto
                  simulated regions through a matrix-vector product. Hierarchical
                  matrices maintain good accuracy of matrix vector products,
                  especially for matrices with a strong diagonal, and can reduce
                  the algorithmic runtime from O(n^2) to about O(nlogn).
                  <br><br>
                  In this project, hierarchical matrices were implemented using
                  Michael Bradley's code
                  <a href="https://github.com/ambrad/dc3dm/tree/main">dc3dm</a>
                  which allowed the interfacing of Matlab and C++. The general
                  simulation code, including the physical problem and IO, were
                  handled in Matlab, with C++ kernels for the accumulation of
                  strain and a C++ interface to handle the matrix vector products.
                  The use of hierarchical matrices greatly improved the runtime
                  and memory use of each matrix vector product, as we can see
                  from the figure below.

                  Additionally, the accuracy of the simulation using hierarchical
                  matrices was minimally affected.
