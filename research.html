                    As a post-masters researcher in the Cosmological Physics and
                    Advanced Computing (CPAC) group at Argonne National Lab, I work
                    closely with Dr. Matthew Becker in the development of a pipeline
                    for a differentiable galaxy-halo connection.

                    As cosmological surveys and simulations improve in scale and
                    resolution, theoretical tools to connect predictions to observed
                    data are crucial to fully realize the scientific potential of
                    these advancements. My work has focused on the development and
                    optimization of tools to connect dark matter simulations to
                    observed summary statistics. I have written a GPU kernel for
                    computing lensing signals, and scaled our code up to several hundred
                    GPUs on Argonne's Polaris and Sunspot computing systems.

                    Currently, I am implementing a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler
                    to sample for the best model parameters. Since our model,
                    primarily developed by Dr. Andrew Hearin, is end to end differentiable,
                    we are able to make use of gradient aware optimization methods which
                    allow for much improved runtimes.

                    I worked with Professor Alexie Leauthaud as an undergraduate
                    and as a masters student while at UCSC. As part of the Merian survey,
                    I participated in remote observations on the Blanco and Keck telescopes,
                    reduced spectral data, and helped to QA the observing pipeline.
                    <br><br>
                    Most recently, I wrote my masters thesis on signals of breathing modes
                    in dwarf galaxies. Breathing modes, or the movement of a galaxy's gas
                    inward and outward as star formation fluctuates, have been
                    theorized as a possible solution to the cusp-core problem of cold dark
                    matter. I analyzed simulation data from the FIRE project and new
                    zoom simulations of dwarf galaxies from the Romulus code, as well
                    as spectral data observed from dwarf galaxies.
                    <br><br>
                    El-Badry et al. (2017) find a correlation between star formation rate
                    and gas velocity in the FIRE simulations, which can be used as an
                    observational test of breathing modes. However, in our Romulus zoom
                    simulations there is no such relation.

                    Comparing the simulation predictions to our Keck data, we find
                    that the Romulus simulations better predict gas velocity / star
                    formation rate relation than the FIRE simulations.

                  The colored circles indicate data from the observed Keck dwarfs,
                  and the x's represent predictions from the Romulus zooms (above)
                  or FIRE galaxies (below). Like the Romulus zoom galaxies, our
                  observed galaxies show no signs of a correlation between star
                  formation rate and gas kinematics, suggesting that other processes
                  are at work in flattening dwarf galaxy density profiles.

                  <p>
                    I spent a summer as an intern at the Southern California
                    Earthquake Center working with Dr. Val√®re Lambert to
                    implement hierarchical matrices into simulations of earthquakes
                    and aseismic slip (SEAS) that include viscoelastic effects.
                    <br><br>
                    The interplay between localized fault slip and off-fault
                    viscoelastic deformation has substantial implications for the
                    loading of stress on faults, the recurrence of earthquake
                    ruptures, and the overall state of stress within the
                    lithosphere. Analytic solutions relating stress and slip
                    allow for efficient inclusion of bulk deformation in SEAS
                    simulation using the integral method. However, in standard
                    boundary integral method implementations, the number of
                    calculations necessary scales quadratically with the
                    number of computational elements, limiting the feasibility of
                    larger scale simulations. Hierarchical matrices provide an approximation
                    to a matrix-vector product, greatly speeding up computation.
                    <br><br>
                    We find that our hierarchical matrix implementation maintains
                    good accuracy and is faster for large matrices. Below, we can see
                    that the slip produced by the hierarchical matrix implementation
                    and a dense matrix implementation are nearly identical.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Additionally, we find that the hierarchical matrix implmentation
                    accurately recreates the strain accumulation of a viscoelastic
                    region between ruptures. There are some differences compared to
                    a dense matrix simulation at regions far from a fault that are
                    a result of the approximations made in the hierarchical matrix
                    vector product.
